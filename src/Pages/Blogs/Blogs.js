                        <p>I'm using firebase for authentication and to host my website. Firebase Authentication aims to make building secure authentication systems easy, while improving the sign-in and onboarding experience for end users. It provides an end-to-end identity solution, supporting email and password accounts, phone auth, and Google, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub login, and more. There are definitely great advantages of using Firebase Authentication. Save time on developing Webservice methods for authentication : Instead, just have a method to store user information after the user authenticates with Firebase.</p>
